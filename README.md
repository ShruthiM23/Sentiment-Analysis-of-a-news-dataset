# Problem Statement:

A  case study of sentiment captured in the news document using NLP.

In this project, I have tried to capture the sentiment that a news document is eminating using 2 rule based approaches. The sentiment labels have been added correspondingly.

2. SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from nltk.sentiment.vader
